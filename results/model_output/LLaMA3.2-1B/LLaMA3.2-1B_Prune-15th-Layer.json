        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage? Should I upgrade my router? How much does upgrading cost?\nThere are several things you can try to improve your wireless signal strength. First, check that you have enough signal strength in your entire house. If you have enough signal strength everywhere except one room, you might want to upgrade your router to improve signal strength in that room.\nSecond, check your wireless signal strength indoors. You might want to upgrade your router if you have strong signal strength outdoors but weak signal strength indoors. If you have weak signal"
