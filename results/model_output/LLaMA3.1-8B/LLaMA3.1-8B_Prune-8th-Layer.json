It is designed to be efficient for real-world data, and has been adopted by the Python programming language.\nThe algorithm works by first identifying “runs” in the input array. A run is a subarray of the input that is already sorted. The algorithm then repeatedly merges runs together until the entire array is sorted.\nThe time complexity of Timsort is O(n log n), which is the same as merge"

The only way to save them is to pull a lever and divert the trolley onto another track, where there is one"
