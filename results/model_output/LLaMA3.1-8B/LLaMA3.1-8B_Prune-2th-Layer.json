What can I do?\nI have an old home and the wireless internet signal is weak in some rooms. How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?\nThere are several things you can do to improve the wireless signal in your home. First, make sure that you are getting the best possible signal from your wireless router. This means making sure that you are using the latest version of wireless technology and that your router is as close to your modem as possible. The modem sends the signal to the router,"

Thank you!\nIt's a bit hard to give you an exact answer, but I can give you a few pointers that might help.\nFirst off, you can use your upload speed to stream a game, but the upload speed has nothing to do with how much bandwidth you can use to play the game online. It's just a simple fact that it takes more bandwidth to stream a game than it does to play a game online. You can use 5mbps upload speed to stream a game and"
