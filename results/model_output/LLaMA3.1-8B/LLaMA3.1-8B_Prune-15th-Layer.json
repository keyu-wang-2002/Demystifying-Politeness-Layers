        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  Will the addition of a router to my home network help?\nIt is common for home Wi-Fi networks to have weak signals in some areas.  This is usually due to the location of the router and the way that Wi-Fi signals travel.  Wi-Fi signals travel in straight lines.  This means that if your router is in a room on the first floor, the signal will be weaker in the second floor because the signal has to travel through the walls of the house.  If your router"
