Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth? Also, what is the minimum download speed to watch a twitch stream at 720p 30fps?\nThe minimum upload speed is 3000kbps. The minimum download speed is 5mbps. The stream will be choppy if you have less upload bandwidth and the stream will lag if you have less download bandwidth. You need to add about 2mbps of headroom on the upload side to prevent any lag during the stream. You do not need any headroom on the download"

        "answer": "what should i call you? how about “mama”?\nWhat do you say to a person who calls you mama? Do you correct them and tell them that you’re not their mother? Do you tell them that you’re just their friend and that they should call you by your name? Or do you just let them call you what they want? I think that’s the best option. It doesn’t hurt to have a nickname, and it shows that you’re close with the person. It makes the person feel special.\n"
