I'm not talking about the philosophical Trolley Problem, but the real-world version, where the choices are between the lives of 5 people and 1, and the choice is not just a matter of whether to pull a lever, but whether to take action to save 5 lives, or to not take action, and save 1 life.\nIn this case, I think the answer is that there is no most ethical response, and there is no true, most ethical response, and the ethical"

Thanks!\nIt is 26,000 light years away from the Earth. That is 26,000 times the distance between the Sun and the Earth. That is a long way away, but it is not very far away in the grand scheme of things. It is about 1/1,000 of the distance between the Earth and the Andromeda galaxy, which is the nearest large galaxy"
