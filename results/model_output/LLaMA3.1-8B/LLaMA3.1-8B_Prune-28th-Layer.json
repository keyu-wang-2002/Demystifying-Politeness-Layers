        "answer": "can you cook an egg only using durect sunlight in any place of our solar system? and will it taste like an egg?\nIt will be a boiled egg. But it will be impossible to boil an egg in direct sunlight in most places on earth because the atmosphere absorbs the UV radiation that is responsible for the heating effect.\nThere are no other places in the solar system where you could boil an egg in direct sunlight. The surface temperature of Mercury is too high. The temperature of Venus is too high. The surface of the moon is too cold. The atmosphere of Mars is too thin."
