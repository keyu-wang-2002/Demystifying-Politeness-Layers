        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  I have a router from Time Warner.\nWireless signal strength can be affected by many things, but in most cases it's the distance from the wireless router that's the issue.  When I have a weak signal in a room, it's often because I'm sitting on the opposite side of the house from the wireless router.  The further away you are from the router, the weaker the signal.  If you're in a room that's right next to the router, you shouldn't"

        "answer": "can you cook an egg only using durect sunlight in any place of our solar system? - Physics\nWhen an object is heated by direct sunlight, it absorbs energy from the sun and converts it into internal energy of the object. This increases the temperature of the object. The object continues to absorb energy until the incoming energy is balanced by the outgoing energy. Since the temperature of the sun is much higher than the temperature of the object, the outgoing energy will always be less than incoming energy. Hence, the temperature of the object will increase until it reaches a steady state. After this, the"

Does the answer to the problem depend on the relationship between the person and the victims, or does the answer remain the same in all cases?\nThe trolley problem is a thought experiment, which is a hypothetical situation that is designed to illustrate a philosophical point. In this case, the trolley problem is designed to illustrate the moral and ethical implications of a situation in which a person must decide whether to sacrifice the lives of five people by doing nothing, or to sacrifice the life of one person by taking action"
