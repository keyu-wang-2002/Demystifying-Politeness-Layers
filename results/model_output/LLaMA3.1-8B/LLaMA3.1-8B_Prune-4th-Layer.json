Is there a way to know if the Trolley Problem is a true scenario?\nThe Trolley Problem is a classic thought experiment in philosophy. It is used to illustrate the differences between a deontological ethical system (which says that what you do is important) and a consequentialist ethical system (which says that what happens is important). In the most basic form, it goes like this:\nA trolley is rolling down the tracks, and there is a switch that can be thrown to divert it."
