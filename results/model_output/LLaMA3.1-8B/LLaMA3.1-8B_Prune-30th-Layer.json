In the first part of this article, we’ll look at ways of improving the wireless signal.\nIf the main cause of poor coverage is distance, the simplest and cheapest way to overcome the problem is to get a range booster.  This is a device that sits on the same network as the router, boosting the wireless signal.  They usually have a range of around 50m, meaning they’re suitable for a typical two or three bedroom house.  The downside is that they often have a"

        "answer": "what should i call you? i am in the process of choosing an alias. it should be something that is both appropriate and yet memorable. it will be something that i will eventually be identified by. this is something that is a bit different to how it is normally done, for when you use an alias, normally the person who you know uses it, does not want to be identified. here the reverse is the case. here i want the alias, but the person you know, wants to remain anonymous."

What can you tell me about these satellites? What era were they developed? Are they still active, and what are their approximate capabilities thought to be? Thanks.\nSome spy satellites had resolution comparable to the very best consumer cameras, others had resolution comparable to the best professional cameras, and others still had resolution comparable to the best professional telescopes. Resolution in this context means the size of the smallest object you could reliably resolve, and resolution is directly proportional to the size of the aperture. Resolution is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the radiation, meaning resolution in visible wavelengths is better than resolution in the infrared, and resolution in the visible is better than resolution"
