        "answer": "can you cook an egg only using durect sunlight in any place of our solar system? What is the longest time you can cook an egg using sunlight in a place in the solar system?\nThe answer depends on the distance from the sun, which is the amount of light that reaches the surface of the egg.\nThe closest planet to the sun is Mercury. The surface of Mercury is very hot. It is about 400 degrees Celsius, which is the temperature at which an egg will cook. Mercury is very close to the sun, so the sun's light can reach the surface of the egg"

The most common response to the Trolley Problem is that a person should do nothing, thus causing the deaths of 5 people, because the person who would be sacrificed would be in the way of the trolley, and therefore a person should not cause harm to someone who has done nothing to harm them. However, the problem with this is that it would be a case of the \"greater good,\" where a person has to choose between the greater good and an individual good, which is the ethical dilemma"

First, I’ll answer the question of what these satellites are and why they’re there. Then, I’ll talk about the different ways that they can be used and what they can and can’t do.\nKeyhole satellites are reconnaissance satellites that are designed to take pictures of the Earth from space.
