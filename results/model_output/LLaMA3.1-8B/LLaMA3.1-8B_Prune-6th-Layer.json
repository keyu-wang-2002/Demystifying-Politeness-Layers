        "answer": "Write a response that disagrees with the following post: \"Technology is everything that doesn't work yet.\" - R. Buckminster Fuller\nThe question here is: What is technology? The question is not as simple as it may seem. A more detailed question is: What is technology in the context of this statement? The statement seems to be saying that technology is only what is useful and not what is not useful. But that is not the case. What is technology is what is possible. What is not useful is not technology. A better way to look at this is that technology is what is possible"

Can it be done?\nThere are multiple ways to detect and locate a drone flying over your property. One way is to use software defined radio (SDR) to detect the drone’s signal. SDR is a type of radio that uses software to define the radio’s frequency and other characteristics. This allows for more flexibility in terms of what can be detected and located.\nTo use SDR to detect a drone flying over your property, you will need to have an SDR receiver and a computer with"
