How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  \nThere are many ways to improve Wi-Fi coverage in your home, including:\n  1. Use a Wi-Fi Extender: A Wi-Fi extender is a device that can be placed in a location with a strong Wi-Fi signal and then used to amplify the signal to areas with poor coverage. Wi-Fi extenders are available in both wired and wireless versions.\n  2. Use a Wi-Fi Repeater: A Wi-Fi repeater is a device that can be placed in an area"
