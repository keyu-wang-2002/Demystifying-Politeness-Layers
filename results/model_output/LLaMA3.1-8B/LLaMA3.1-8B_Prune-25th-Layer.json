Is the answer the same for the 5 people as it is for the one person?\nThis is a fascinating ethical question, and it is the subject of some serious philosophical debate. The question has been posed many ways, but one of the more common forms is the Trolley Problem. In this version, you are standing on a bridge, above a trolley track, which is running through a city. There is a trolley car coming down the tracks, which is going to hit 5 people"

Thanks.\nThe KH satellites were active in the 1960s and 70s, and were capable of imaging at a resolution of 1 meter. I believe the highest resolution images from KH satellites were taken from orbit in 1972, but the last KH satellite wasn’t launched until 1985. The KH series was retired in 1992."
