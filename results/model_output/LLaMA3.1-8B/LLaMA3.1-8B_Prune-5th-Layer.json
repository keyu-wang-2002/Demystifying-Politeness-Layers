        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage? I've heard of \"mesh\" systems, but I'm not sure if they are for me.\nThe mesh network system is the best solution for you.  The mesh system connects several wireless access points (WAPs) together and uses a protocol that allows the WAPs to route around any obstacles in the signal path.  The WAPs are placed throughout the house, in each room that needs coverage.  The mesh network is self-configuring, so it is easy to set up"
