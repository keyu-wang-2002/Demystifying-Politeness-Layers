I don't need to stream my gameplay, but I want to make sure the quality is good and I can stream if I need to.\nIn general, the higher the bitrate the better. You can always lower it down later if you find that you have too much bandwidth. You can also always increase it if you find that you are having issues with buffering. Twitch recommends a bitrate of 3000kbps, but you can go much higher than that if you have the bandwidth to do so.\n"
