        "answer": "can you cook an egg only using durect sunlight in any place of our solar system??\nI'm not sure how long it would take, but you can cook an egg by the sun. It's not a good idea to cook an egg in a place with no atmosphere. The radiation would be intense.\nThe Sun is not the only source of heat in space, of course. A planet with an atmosphere has a greenhouse effect that keeps it warmer than it would be otherwise."
