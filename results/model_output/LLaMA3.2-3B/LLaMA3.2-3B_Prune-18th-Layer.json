        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  What can you tell me about wireless routers and access points?\nThe wireless signal in your house is probably weak in some rooms because you haven't placed your access point in the right spot.  Wireless access points are designed to transmit and receive wireless signals through walls, floors, and ceilings.  If you put the access point on the wall or ceiling of a room, the signal will travel through the walls or ceiling.  If you put the access point in a closet, the signal will bounce off"
