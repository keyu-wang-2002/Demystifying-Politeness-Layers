        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  Should I consider getting a Wi-Fi repeater?\nWireless signals travel in all directions, so a weak signal from your router can be as far as 100 feet from your computer. The further the distance, the weaker the signal.  If you want to strengthen the signal, a Wi-Fi repeater is a good choice.\nA Wi-Fi repeater is an inexpensive way to boost the signal. It receives the signal from your wireless router and retransmits it to your computer.  The"
