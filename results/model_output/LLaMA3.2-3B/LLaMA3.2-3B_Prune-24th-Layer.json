        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage? \n\n# Solution: \n\nTo improve the weak wireless signal in your home, consider the following steps: \n\n1. **Upgrade to a stronger, faster Wi-Fi router:**  If your current router is outdated or not powerful enough, consider upgrading to a new, more advanced model. Make sure to choose a router that offers the latest Wi-Fi technology, such as  802.11ac. Additionally, look for a model that has multiple antennas to improve signal strength and coverage. \n\n2."
