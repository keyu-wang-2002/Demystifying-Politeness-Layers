If you can, can you also cook another egg using only the same sunlight?\nNo. The sun's energy is not sufficient to cook an egg. The sun is not hot enough. The sun would have to be much hotter than it is now.\nThe heat of the sun is not enough to cook an egg, but if you could somehow increase the heat of the sun to the point that the egg would start to cook, the heat would eventually kill the egg.

It seems to me that a response to the trolley problem is more ethical if one can sacrifice their own life to save 5 people, rather than sacrificing the lives of 5 people by inaction, thus not pulling the lever.
