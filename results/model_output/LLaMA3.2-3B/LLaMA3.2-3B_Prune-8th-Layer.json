        "answer": "The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?  What are the options?\nOne of the most common problems with wireless Internet access is weak coverage.  Wireless coverage is usually limited by the strength of the Wi-Fi signal from your wireless access point (WAP) and by the number of walls and floors between the WAP and your computer.  A weak signal can result in slow data transfer rates, dropped connections, and a loss of coverage in some areas.  This article will discuss some options for improving your Wi-Fi coverage.\nThe first step"
