The idea is to start with an insertion sort on the input array, then merge adjacent subarrays that are sorted by insertion sort. Timsort has the following properties:\n- Stable: Timsort always maintains the relative order of equal elements.\n- In-place: Timsort only requires a small amount of memory to work, and it sorts the input array in-place.\n"
