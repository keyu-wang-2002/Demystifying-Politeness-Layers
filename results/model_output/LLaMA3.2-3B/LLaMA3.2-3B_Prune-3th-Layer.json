For example, the atmosphere of Mars is too cold to support life, but if you could somehow create a greenhouse effect (a greenhouse is a device that uses the sun's rays to heat up a place) then life can exist there. Venus is the closest planet to the Sun, but the thick atmosphere makes it too hot for"

The question of ethical behavior in the face of this dilemma has troubled many philosophers, and a number of them have come up with interesting answers. We’ll start with one of the most famous, the Utilitarian, who says that we should act to maximize the total amount of happiness, and that we should also act to maximize the total amount of pain avoidance. The Trolley Problem is a good example of where these two principles might come into conflict. Let’s say we’re standing at a T-junction"
