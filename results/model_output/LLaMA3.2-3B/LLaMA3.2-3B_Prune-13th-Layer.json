The energy from the sun is spread out over the entire planet. If you can catch the energy from the sun and focus it into a single spot, then you can boil an egg. But the energy from the sun is spread out over the entire planet, so you can't get enough energy to boil an egg. It would be a very inefficient way of cooking eggs.\nI have read that you can use a magn"

This is the classic Trolley Problem, and there is no consensus on what the right response is.\nThere are two answers to this problem. The first is the most obvious, and is to pull the lever and let the lives of the 5 people perish. The problem is, this is the only action that is consistent with utilitarianism, which holds that the greatest good for the greatest number of people is the right thing to do. Utilitarianism is the only moral system that holds that killing"

What can you tell me about these satellites? What era were they developed? Are they still active, and what are their approximate capabilities thought to be? What was their original purpose?\nThis is a great question. Unfortunately, the answer is that the satellites were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, and their capabilities were classified. The only thing we know for sure is that they were not as good as the KH-9 satellites that they replaced, and that they were in use during the 1970s and 1980s. There is some speculation that they were in use into the 1990s as well,"
