Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth? Is 5mbps enough?\nA 3000kbps upload speed is for a 720p stream at 30fps. The upload speed required to stream at 1080p is 10mbps, which is about 3 times as much. You will need an additional 5mbps of upload speed to stream at 1080p at 60fps. This will vary depending on the bitrate of your stream."
